In this document, I am looking at the max and min values of water levels in Grand Isle, LA. I have retrieved data from the years 2000 and 2020 to see the 20 year difference in water levels to see if global warming has impacted the sea level rise in Grand Isle. Grand Isle, Louisiana is a barrier island that is 6 miles long and 0.6 miles wide (Jones, et al., 2011). Grand Isle is the only inhabitable town on the barrier islands in Louisiana. Since the 1800’s, this town has been devastated by flood events. On average, Grand Isle has a flooding event ever 2.68 years (US Army, 2021). I would like to look at the sea level rising over time and projections of future sea level rises in this area, from NOAA, to see how much the shoreline has changed due to these frequent floods.

Between the years 1974-1990, it was estimated that nearly 5,700 acres of wetlands were removed in the Barataria Basin, where Grand Isle resides (CWPPRA). The removal of wetlands played a critical role in escalating erosion due to storm surge in Grand Isle. In 2010, the city of Grand isle built a 7.7 mile long, 13 feet high and 80 feet wide levee to protect their coasts from storm surge. However, in 2020, the levee was partially destroyed by Tropical Storm Cristobal and Hurricane Zeta (American Press). 

Grand Isle has been beaten and battered by many floods, either from levee failures or storm events. Over the last 70 years, the sea level in Grand Isle has risen more than 2 feet, estimating about 0.3 inches per year (Pulitzer Center, 2021). I would like to determine how detrimental the sea level rise to this community and if there are any conservation efforts that can occur to minimize these effects, or if Grand Isle will ultimately be faced with the inevitable displacement due to sea level rise.
